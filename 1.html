<h3>Hypertext</h3> documents are interconnected by hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click,
<p>keypress set or by touching the screen. Apart from text, the term "hypertext" is also sometimes used to describe tables, images,
and other presentational content formats with integrated hyperlinks.<p> Hypertext is one of the key underlying concepts of the World Wide Web,
where Web pages are often written in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).<p>
As implemented on the Web, hypertext enables the easy-to-use publication of information over the Internet.
