<h2>MEDIA QUERIES</h2>
<u>History</u>
<hr>
<h2>Tests</h2>
<p><h2>Media Queries</h2> is an enhancement of the @media rules of CSS and the “media” attribute in HTML. It adds parameters such as size of display, color depth and aspect ratio. This is because within a class of media (such as TV sets) there can still be important variations. It is related to the work on CC/PP, but is a much more light-weight and limited solution.</p>

<p><h2>MEDIA QUERIES LEVEL 4
History
Media Queries</h2> defines a syntax for short expressions that describe required features of media (or devices), e.g.: minimum or maximum screen size, color capabilities, resolution, aspect ratio, type of pointing device, viewing environment, scripting capabilities, etc. Media Queries is related to the work on CC/PP, but is a more light-weight and limited solution.</p>

<p><h2>Such expressions </h2>can be attached as labels to style sheets or other resources, to indicate what media they are designed for. They are used, e.g., in HTML (in the media attribute). CSS uses them on '@import' and '@media' and they occur in similar ways in SVG and generic XML.</p>

<p><h2>Media Queries</h2> level 4 is an extended version of the first Media Queries. It adds a handful of new media features, such as 'pointer' and 'hover' (for capabilities of the pointing device) and 'block-overflow' (for paged vs scrolling media), which provide more precise information about the media than the old 'handheld' vs 'screen' and 'projection' vs 'screen' distinctions.</p>
